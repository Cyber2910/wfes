# k-NN attack by Wang et al. 2014

The original code is by Tao Wang: https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/software/webfingerprint/knn.zip.

I modified it so it can be exported as a library and called from Python.
I also fixed a few bugs (only documented in the source code for now) and
removed some unnecessary parts.

Diff files .diff are also provided, showing the edits from the original code.
